# Automated Web Testing – Selenium & Python

## Project Description

This repository contains automated UI tests for a web application, implemented using **Python, Selenium WebDriver and pytest**.

The project reflects a **practical, production-oriented approach to test automation**, focused on maintainability, clarity and repeatable regression scenarios.

This is an anonymized version of a real testing project created for a commercial application.  
All sensitive data, credentials and access URLs have been removed or replaced.

## Scope of Testing

The automated tests cover:
- authentication and login-related scenarios
- basic user interactions within the application
- validation of expected UI behaviour and error handling

The test suite is designed to support **regular regression testing** and basic smoke tests after deployments.

---

## Technical Approach

The project is built with the following principles and tools:
- **Selenium WebDriver** for browser automation
- **pytest** as the test execution framework
- **Page Object Model (POM)** to separate test logic from UI structure
- **data-driven testing** for handling multiple input scenarios
- **Faker** library for generating realistic and repeatable test data
- clear test documentation aligned with automated scenarios

---

## Test Documentation

In addition to automated scripts, the repository includes manual test cases describing:
- test steps
- preconditions
- expected results

This allows the project to be understood and maintained by both technical and non-technical team members.

---

## Related Work

The login functionality of the same application has also been automated using **Robot Framework** in a separate repository.

---

## Focus

The main goal of this project is not to demonstrate isolated features, but to show:
- a maintainable test structure
- readable and reusable test scenarios
- an approach suitable for long-term project maintenance
