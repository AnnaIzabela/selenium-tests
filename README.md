# Selenium Test Portfolio

## 🧪 Automated Web Testing Project 
This repository contains automated test scripts written in Python using Selenium WebDriver and Pytest.  
The project demonstrates my skills in:
- Page Object Model (POM) structure
- Data-driven testing
- Test documentation 
- Use of Faker library for generating test data

**Note:**  
This is an anonymized version of a real testing project for a commercial application.  
All sensitive data and access URLs have been replaced or removed to ensure confidentiality.


## Overview

- Automated tests are implemented using **Selenium WebDriver** and **pytest**.
- Tests cover login functionality and basic operations on the application.
- The repository includes both test scripts and corresponding test cases.
- The login functionality of the application is also implemented in **Robot Framework** in a separate repository.

## Folder Structure

- `selenium_test/` – Contains Python scripts for automated tests.
- `test_cases/` – Contains test cases documenting steps, expected results, and conditions.
